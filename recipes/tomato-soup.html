    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 slice onion</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong> In a stockpot, over medium heat, combine the
        tomatoes, large slice of onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth. Bring
        to a boil, and gently boil for about 20 minutes to blend all of the
        flavors. Remove from heat and run the mixture through a food mill into a
        large bowl, or pan. Discard any stuff left over in the food mill.

        <strong>Step 2</strong> In the now empty stockpot, melt the butter over
        medium heat. Stir in the flour to make a roux, cooking until the roux is
        a medium brown. Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture, so that
        no lumps form, then stir in the rest. Season with sugar and salt, and
        adjust to taste.
