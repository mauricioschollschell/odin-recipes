      <p>Moist caramel cake with delicious layers of cake and caramel icing.</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Cake:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups butter</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Icing:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 1</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
          C). Grease and flour three 9-inch cake pans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2</strong> Make cake: Place white sugar and butter into a
          mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light
          and fluffy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3</strong> Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a
          separate bowl. Add flour mixture in batches, alternating with milk,
          beating batter briefly after each addition. Add vanilla extract; beat
          until batter makes ribbons when falling from the beaters. Divide
          batter among the prepared cake pans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 4</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
          inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool on a
          wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen.
          Invert carefully onto a cooling rack. Let cool, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 5</strong> Make icing: Combine brown sugar, butter, and
          salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until brown sugar is
          dissolved, about 3 minutes. Add evaporated milk and continue stirring.
          Bring to a gentle boil and let bubble for about 4 minutes, stirring
          constantly to avoid sticking. Remove from heat and allow to cool,
          about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 6</strong> Mix confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract
          into brown sugar mixture using an electric mixer until icing
          caramelizes and thickens to the desired consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 7</strong> Spread icing onto cooled cake layers. Stack
          layers; ice top and sides.
        </li>
