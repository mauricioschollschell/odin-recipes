      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
        topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce
        from scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk,
        Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats
        every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni
        and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or
        alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.
